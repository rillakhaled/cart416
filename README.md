# cart416

CART 416 is a game studio focused on creating games that have intended purposes alongside entertainment – whether these be expressive, critical, persuasive, learning, or otherwise “serious” in nature. It will involve experimentation with and reflection on how we embed meaning in game systems and play experiences, as well as following through and examining what the effects of these experiences are on players. It will also involve working with a real client who has a need for such a game. Throughout the semester, working in teams, students will progressively move from developing a playable concept around a rhetorical/experiential intention as provided by a client, towards designing and developing a functional digital game prototype, which will potentially be ready for actual release and deployment.
